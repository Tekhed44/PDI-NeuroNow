# NeuroNow

NeuroNow is a conversational AI integration for ServiceNow, powered by OpenAI’s API. It enables developers and admins to interact with ServiceNow through natural language to automate processes, query data, build content, and populate records.

---

## Note

You will require an OpenAi account and you can put as little as $5 USD on it for a few days worth of heavy use....maybe more. In the last 30 days I've spent $7.75 for 16.5M input tokens. That's me testing.

## How It Works

NeuroNow connects ServiceNow to OpenAI's Assistants using a structured tool-execution framework. Here's the flow:

1. **User Enters Prompt in Service Portal**  
   Through the GPT Portal UI widget, a user submits a natural language prompt (e.g., "Add a user named Bruce Wayne").

2. **Assistant Matches the Prompt to a Tool**  
   In OpenAI, a pre-configured assistant uses embedded functions (tools) to match prompts to specific function calls (e.g., `create_sys_user`).  
   These tools must be installed in your OpenAI assistant — see **[NeuroNow Extras](https://github.com/MarsLandingMedia/NeuroNow-Extras)**.

3. **Tool Call Sent to ServiceNow**  
   The matched tool call (including its arguments) is routed back to ServiceNow through the API and handled by NeuroNow logic.

4. **ServiceNow Skill is Executed**  
   NeuroNow maps the tool call to a matching script in the `u_neuronow_openai_skills` table (based on the function name).  
   The script is executed using `gptSkillRunner`, and the result is returned to OpenAI and shown in the portal.

5. **System Responds and Holds Context**  
   Threads and messages are persisted so the LLM can continue the conversation with full context.

## Features

### Conversational Intelligence with Context
- Persistent threads and messages stored in custom tables.
- User identity and session context retained throughout multi-step interactions.

### Tool (Skill) Execution via API
- Dynamically runs functions defined in the `u_neuronow_openai_skills` table.
- Supports input/output chaining via `submit_tool_outputs`.
- Tools are validated for security and scoped execution.

### Reference Field Resolution
- Step-by-step guidance for selecting and resolving reference values.
- Supports fuzzy matching and exploration of options before committing.
- Demonstrates intelligent behavior even with vague prompts.

### Record Traversal & Code Review
- Ask the system to review or explain Script Includes or other code records.
- Readable feedback and structured suggestions are returned in real time.

### Advanced Record Querying
- Use natural prompts to query any table and return custom field lists.
- Supports both encoded query and field:value formats.
- Results can be returned in raw or display value format.

### Structured Async Processing
- Asynchronous execution supported via Event system (`x_neuronow.gpt.openai.async.run`).
- Good candidate for scale-out solutions using Queue-based workers.

### Multi-User & Dynamic Record Creation
- Add multiple users or records simultaneously.
- Use vague criteria ("Pick 5 Marvel heroes") and let the LLM generate values.

### Developer-Oriented Use Cases
- Create catalog items, update widgets, or review code with prompts.
- Explore system fields, schema, and record content dynamically.
- Easily extensible with additional skill records and assistant tools.

## Installation

### Step 1: Import the Application

- Install NeuroNow by cloning this repository into a ServiceNow scoped app.
- Ensure all script includes, tables, and widgets are present and active.

### Step 2: Install ServiceNow Functions update set from the NeuroNow Extras repo. 
** IT WILL NOT WORK WITHOUT THESE **
- **[NeuroNow Extras](https://github.com/MarsLandingMedia/NeuroNow-Extras)**
- You can build your own, but on initial install the portal will not work if these are not there.
- ** YOU MUST HAVE CORESPONDING OPENAI FUNCTIONS/TOOLS THAT CALL YOUR SERVICENOW FUNCTIONS. ** These are also included in the 'extra' package. 

### Step 3: Configure System Properties

Set the following properties in **System Properties** or use scripting to apply them.

| Property                                      | Type     | Description                              | Notes                                                                 |
|----------------------------------------------|----------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `x_neuronow.gpt.openai.api.key`              | password | Your OpenAI API Key                      | **This will be visible in the event queue...for now...unless you change this yourself.** |
| `x_neuronow.gpt.openai.assistantid`          | string   | Your Assistant ID                        |                                                                       |
| `x_neuronow.gpt.chat.input.placeholder`      | string   | Placeholder for the portal chat input    | Already set by default.                                                                      |
| `x_neuronow.gpt.openai.agent.name`           | string   | Display name shown for the AI            | Already set by default.                                                                      |
| `x_neuronow.gpt.portal.title`                | string   | Title used in the Service Portal header  | Already set by default.                                                                     |

## Example Prompt and Tool Call

> **Prompt:**  
> "Add a user to the sys_user table with the real name Bruce Wayne. Use the username bwayne, title him CEO, and set the email to bruce.wayne@wayneenterprises.com."

The assistant interprets this and generates a structured OpenAi tool call like the following:

```json
{
  "type": "function_call",
  "name": "create_sys_user",
  "description": "Creates a new user in the sys_user table in ServiceNow.",
  "parameters": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "first_name": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "The user's first name."
      },
      "last_name": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "The user's last name."
      },
      "user_name": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "The user's login name."
      },
      "email": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "The user's email address."
      },
      "title": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "The user's job title."
      }
    },
    "required": ["first_name", "last_name", "user_name"],
    "additionalProperties": false
  },
  "arguments": {
    "first_name": "Bruce",
    "last_name": "Wayne",
    "user_name": "bwayne",
    "email": "bruce.wayne@wayneenterprises.com",
    "title": "CEO"
  }
} 
```
The object is processed in the corresponding ServiceNow skills function like so:
```javascript
(function() {
    var user = new GlideRecord('sys_user');
    user.initialize();
    user.first_name = input.first_name;
    user.last_name = input.last_name;
    user.user_name = input.user_name;

    if (input.email)
        user.email = input.email;

    if (input.title)
        user.title = input.title;

    user.insert();

    return JSON.stringify({
        success: true,
        sys_id: user.getUniqueValue(),
        message: "User '" + input.first_name + " " + input.last_name + "' created successfully."
    });
})();
```
